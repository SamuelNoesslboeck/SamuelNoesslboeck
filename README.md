## Hi - Servus

My name is Samuel and I love to tinker around in different areas of tech but especially in robotics!  
I have created an overview of my projects below, it's all open source and free to use, maybe you find something useful or slightly interesting :D

## Project overview

- **Robots**
  - [Bugsy](https://github.com/SamuelNoesslboeck/Bugsy.git): A simple robot designed for some control and SLAM tests
    - [bug_os](https://github.com/SamuelNoesslboeck/bug_os.git): Low-level control software for the Bugsy robot
  - [Crabsy](https://github.com/zvv2/Crabsy.git): A hexapod robot designed to be taught by AI
    - [CrabOS](https://github.com/SamuelNoesslboeck/crab_os.git): Low-level control software for the Crabsy robot
  - [DrAI](https://github.com/SamuelNoesslboeck/DrAI.git): Diploma Project of [Rene Schwarz](https://github.com/SchwarzRene) and mine
